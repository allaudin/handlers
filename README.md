## Ease Volley Wrapper

**Ease** is a wrapper around [Volley](https://github.com/google/volley) for handling network 
responses more effectively. It offers **auto parsing** of response to **any specific** type with **clean**
and **intuitive** API for creating requests and handling responses.

By default, _Ease_ gives support for handling following kind of responses but configuring it 
for **any other** response is tremendously easy, it is just a matter updating a single Class (Response Type). 

    {
 	    "result_description": "des",
 	    "data": {}
    }
                 
    {
  	    "result_description": "des",
  	    "data": [{}]
    }

## Why should I use Ease?

[Volley](https://github.com/google/volley) offers a simple API for handling network calls and responses, 
but for relatively bigger projects it is cumbersome to stick with default Volley API for handling 
network calls.

1. While Volley's toolbox supports many Request formats out of the box, it does not allow us to parse response 
to a **specific or desired type**. 

2. Volley's default response listener does not allow to handle multiple request with same callback handler.

3. When there is more than a single request on an Activity or Fragment, it pollutes code with anonymous 
handlers making it hard to read and maintain.

4. It does not support (by default) progress dialogs, you have to write your own for showing it before a 
network call.


> **Ease** is designed with having all the above issues in mind. It does most of the work on behalf of 
> developers, leaving behind the **minimal** work for them.



## Building a Request

Creating a request with *Ease* is literally easy. 

  1. Creating Request Headers *[Optional]*
  
      ```java
      RequestHeaders headers = RequestHeaders.newInstance().put("some", "value").put("key", "va");
      ```
  2. Creating Request Body *[Optional]*   
  
      ```java
       RequestBody body = RequestBody.newInstance().put("body", "value").put("other", "val");
      ```
  
  3. Creating Request
  
  
      ```java
        EaseRequest.type(new TypeToken<EaseResponse<List<UserModel>>>(){}) // type token discussed below
                        .method().post() // request type
                        .body(body) // body created in step 2
                        .headers(headers) // headers created in step 1
                        .requestId(100) // request ID for this request
                        .endPoint("users") 
                        .responseCallbacks(this) // callbacks
                        .build().execute(this); // this = context
      ```

## Creating type tokens

In order to parse a network response to arbitrary objects using *Gson* you need to pass `type information` of the `Object`
to `Ease`. This can be done with `TypeToken` class which accepts required type as parametrized type. e.g.

    new TypeToken<EaseResponse<List<UserModel>>>(){}

It will convert the *data* key from network response into a list of `UserModels`.

This syntax is a little ugly but we have no other choice in case of *Generic types*.

## Getting response as String

Typically `Ease` will convert network response to required type but sometimes you want it without conversion e.g. in case 
you want to receive many requests with same callback, taking the responsibility of converting *JSON* response
to model yourself. For this purpose, `Ease` provides `asString(Class<T>)` method for getting response as String.

      EaseRequest.asString(String.class)...

## Receiving Response

Ease offers a clean way for handling network response by using `EaseCallbacks` interface. For 
above example response can be handheld as following.

```java

   @Override
    public void onSuccess(@NonNull EaseRequest<List<UserModel>> request, @NonNull String description, @NonNull List<UserModel> data) {
            // on success, use request.id() for getting request id.
    }


    @Override
    public void onFailure(@NonNull EaseRequest<List<UserModel>> request, @NonNull String description) {
            // request failed with description
    }


    @Override
    public void onError(@NonNull EaseRequest<List<UserModel>> request, @NonNull EaseException e) {
            // error occured while connecting to server
    }
    
```


## Running network call in background

For running network calls in background, you can call `runInBackground()` while building network request. If 
network call is running in background **no progress dialog will be shown to user**.

## Setting progress dialog for all requests

`Ease` require `EaseDialog` object for displaying progress dialog. `Ease` comes with 
default implementation of this interface, however you can set your own implementation
as default by passing your own implementation from `EaseUtisl.getDefaultDialog()` method.

With each request, client has an option to pass `EaseDialog` to specific request.
